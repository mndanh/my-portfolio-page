# My Portfolio Page

for this assignment I had to create a webpage to showcase my portfolio of work and to tell the user more about myself. I used the project from our first homework assignment to be the main project that the website visitor sees when they are browsing my page. Because it is the only assignment I've done, the other links and websites were to show how I would position other projects on my page in a desktop version and the smaller window of a phone. I used some common websites that I use on the internet.
